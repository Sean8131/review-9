## David Downs

## When life throws challenges your way, how do you perceive the world? 

## This was a key question David Downs posed during his presentation at Take2 this morning. David has led a vibrant and varied life. At 22, he dropped out of university and set up a comedy club. He then launched his own tech business before travelling across Asia as a Microsoft business consultant. After leaving Microsoft, he worked at New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, where he met Cameron Smith, Take2’s founder and CEO.

## A significant turning point came when David was 45.

## Following a routine doctor's visit due to feeling unwell, David was diagnosed with lymphoma and given just a 20% chance of survival. After nine months of unsuccessful chemotherapy, he flew to Boston to participate in a groundbreaking clinical cancer treatment trial, which ultimately led to his recovery.

## Was it solely the treatment that cured him? Yes and no. 

## David emphasised that while some people succumb to self-pity, he realised the importance of staying motivated and optimistic during tough times. He adopted the mindset that he was an active participant in his own life, not a victim, and reminded himself that we get good at what we practice.

## So, he practised optimism—starting each day by making his bed, which helped him feel better and build momentum.

## David firmly believes that we can transform our reality by changing our mindset—a quality he feels distinguishes humans from animals. During the talk, he encouraged us to focus on what we can change and what’s within our control. 

## Does David consider himself lucky? Again, yes and no. 

## He attributes his luck to having friends, working hard, maintaining a positive attitude, and having opportunities. He's made a habit of putting himself in situations where he doesn't know what he's doing and learning on the job.

## Thank you for sharing your experiences and life lessons with us, David. I left your talk feeling inspired, hopeful, and optimistic.
